# Project-TwoNote
originally hosted on <a href = "https://gitlab.com/jorge.aparicio/TwoNote"> GitLab. </a>

- Adapted to using a Toolkit (PyGobject), learned Python as well while doing project. 
- Developed algorithms in order to create, rename, edit and delete notebooks/notes using knowledge learned from data structures course.  
- Full-Stack using Native GTK API, Libraries, and Toolkits.
- Created to fill the missing gap for a good note taking app in Linux, currently in Alpha. 

Responsibilities:

Front End Portion: I created the sidebar menu that contains the notebooks and notes using the PyGtk API, I also helped out with implementing the toolbar. We are still trying to understand how to properly implement the toolbar using the API. I also configured the text view to receive text. Using the API I also made the windows for deleting, renaming, creating notebooks/notes.

Back End Portion: I developed the algorithms for creating, deleting, and renaming the notebooks/notes. Using knowledge from my data structures course, the Notebooks are stored in lists and inside the Notebooks are a list that represents the pages. I used multiple instance variables to represent the current notebook, page, and buttons (for the gui). I also added safeguards so that notebooks/notes can't be named or renamed to an existing notebook/note.


Project TwoNote is a note taking web app my good friend and I decided to build in the summer of 2018. In the process of doing so we learned Python, the PyGobject API and how to adapt to using a toolkit in order to implement the apps GUI. Our inspiration for making the app is the lack of good note taking apps Linux has to offer. The application uses a design thats intuitive, convenient, and subscribes to the native GTK design language. Our goal for this app is to make it the staple of Linux users productivity applications.

A huge challenge for us was getting through the learning curve that comes with learning an API along with learning how python works. Out of all the components, the sidebar menu was the most time consuming to implement. With that being said, I'm proud of the progress we've made and I look forward to adding more features that optimize the client's experience.

The application is currently in alpha.
